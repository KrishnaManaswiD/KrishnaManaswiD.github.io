The unit combines mechatronics engineering with entrepreneurship. It introduces students to fundamental entrepreneurial concepts and skills. Students will work in a team and apply their new knowledge in entrepreneurship to devise an idea for a robotic device that solves a problem for a client. They will identify and understand technical and non-technical client needs, with awareness of indigenous perspectives and the ethics of robots in society.

I am a tutor for this unit along with Dr. Fernando Venegas Alvarez
