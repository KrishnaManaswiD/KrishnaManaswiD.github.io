I will be teaching the soft robotics practicals course at EPFL with my colleagues Yegor Piskarev and Vivek Ramachandran.
Students will be trained on manufacturing artificial muscles based on dielectric elastomer actuators. They will get a chance to both fabricate and characterise these actuators.
We will also teach them about electrostatic adhesion. At the end of the course, the students will be able to design, test and analyse their very own soft robot.
