I was one an instructor on the robotics practicals course at EPFL with my colleague Yegor Piskarev.
Students were trained on manufacturing artificial muscles based on dielectric elastomer actuators. They got a chance to both fabricate and characterise these actuators.
We also taught them about electrostatic adhesion. At the end of the course, the students designed, tested and analysed their very own soft robot.
