I am assisting Prof. Dario Floreano and Dr. Euan Judd in teaching the Evolutionary Robotics course at EPFL.
The course offers an introduction to evolutionary computation, its applications to neural computation, robot control, body-brain co-design, and evolutionary biology. Students are also exposed to open research topics that resort to evolutionary computation, such as self-repairing robots, self-reproducing robots, tensegrity robot control, and biohybrid robots. The course consists of ex-cathedra lectures, lab exercises with Phython, and a team project on  co-evolution of robotic brains and bodies.
