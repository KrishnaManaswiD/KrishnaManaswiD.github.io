This project at LMTS, EPFL led to the development of electrically shielded capacitive force sensors, that simultaneously measure normal and shear strains, even near electric sparks. The devices have sub-mN force resolution in both normal and shear directions, can measure forces larger than 10 N, and operate reliably after repeated loading to 20 N load. Performance is unaffected by nearby high DC and AC electric fields, allowing use in a wide range of robotic sensing applications.
