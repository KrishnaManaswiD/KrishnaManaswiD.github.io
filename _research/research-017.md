Picking up and manipulating fragile materials is a challenge for traditional robotic grippers. In this work, we use electrostatic attraction to handle these materials in a reliable manner.

This work was presented at the IEEE International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS), 2021. Access the paper on the [publisher's website](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9636095).
