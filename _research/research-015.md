Upper limb robotic prosthetic devices currently lack adequate sensory feedback, contributing to a high rejection rate. Incorporating affective sensory feedback into these devices reduces phantom limb pain and increases control and acceptance. To address the lack of sensory feedback we designed the B:Ionic glove, wearable over a robotic hand which contains sensing, computation and actuation on board.
