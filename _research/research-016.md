3D printing with multifunctional materials enables a new generation of soft robots with complex abilities. In this work, we focus on printing using Konjac Glucomannan gels. A new recipe that combines this polysaccharide with Borax was investigated as a means to achieve a stimuli-responsive and self healing gel. We present the entire process from preparing the gel to fabricating three dimensional free-form structures. 

This work is now published in the 3D Printing and Additive Manufacturing journal. Access the paper on the [publisher's website](https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/10.1089/3dp.2020.0289).
