Electrostatic clutching is an attractive means of changing stiffness on demand. Exploiting the simple tendency of oppositely charged surfaces to attract each other, one can control stiffness, friction and a whole host of other mechanical properties by controlling the electric field. 

This idea was explored in two projects. In the first case (at LMTS, EPFL), to stiffen a pneumatic finger and in the second case (at LIS, EPFL) to stiffen a cylindrical member that is part of a tensegrity structure.
