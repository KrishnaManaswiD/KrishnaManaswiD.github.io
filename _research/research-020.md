Robots using classical control have proven less effective when the manipulated objects are deformable due to their unpredictable behaviour.
In this work at LIS, EPFL, we used a tactile sensor to continuously monitor forces when a deformable object (fabric) was grasped. We trained a model to distinguish between successful grasps, slippage and failure during a manipulation task. Slippage could be anticipated before failure occurred using data acquired over a 30 ms period with a greater than 95% accuracy.
