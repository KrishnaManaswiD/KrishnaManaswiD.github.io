I am a doctoral student at the [SoftLab](http://www.bristol.ac.uk/engineering/research/softlab/), University of Bristol. I work with [Prof. Jonathan Rossiter](http://www.bris.ac.uk/engineering/people/person/jonathan-m-rossiter/overview.html) and [Dr. Andrew Conn](http://www.bris.ac.uk/engineering/people/person/andrew-t-conn/overview.html).
My PhD is part of the [FARSCOPE programme](http://farscope.bris.ac.uk/) at the [Bristol Robotics Lab](http://brl.ac.uk).

My research sits at the interface between biology and engineering and its underlying theme has been to discern biological design through the modelling of natural systems and adapt it to robotic applications. In my thesis, I am looking at the *Euglena* family of microorganisms, understanding their unique manner of swimming and designing robots that mimic their behaviour.

Check out some of my projects and go through my publications for a sample of my research.
