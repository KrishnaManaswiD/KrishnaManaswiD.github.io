I am a research associate at the [SoftLab](http://www.bristol.ac.uk/engineering/research/softlab/), part of the [Bristol Robotics Lab](http://brl.ac.uk). I work with [Prof. Jonathan Rossiter](http://www.bris.ac.uk/engineering/people/person/jonathan-m-rossiter/overview.html).

My research sits at the interface between biology and engineering and its underlying theme has been to discern biological design through the modelling of natural systems and adapt it to robotic applications. 

Check out some of my projects and go through my publications for a sample of my research.
