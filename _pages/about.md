I am a scientist at the soft transducers lab, [LMTS](https://www.epfl.ch/labs/lmts/) and the laboratory of intelligent systems [LIS](https://www.epfl.ch/labs/lis/) at EPFL.

I have more than 10 years of experience in building and programming robots. I worked on applications in automated grasping, locomotion, wearables, healthcare, and soft robotics. My training includes a unique combination of skills in mechanics, electronics, programming, materials, mathematics, machine learning, and data analysis. My work resulted in the successful development of multiple devices, actuators, sensors, new materials, fabrication techniques, characterization methods and test benches. I presented my work at the top conferences and best journals of robotics and invented a new technology for grasping.

My research sits at the interface between biology and engineering. Its underlying theme has been to discern biological design at multiple size scales through the modelling of natural systems and adapt it to robotic applications. 

I received my PhD from the University of Bristol. My work was with the [SoftLab](http://www.bristol.ac.uk/engineering/research/softlab/), part of the [Bristol Robotics Lab](https://brl.ac.uk). It was supervised by [Prof. Jonathan Rossiter](https://www.bris.ac.uk/engineering/people/person/jonathan-m-rossiter/overview.html) and [Dr. Andrew Conn](https://www.bris.ac.uk/engineering/people/andrew-t-conn/index.html). A copy of my doctoral thesis can be accessed [here](https://research-information.bris.ac.uk/files/206707844/Final_Copy_2019_06_25_Digumarti_PhD_Redacted.pdf).
