I am a doctoral student at the [SoftLab](http://www.bristol.ac.uk/engineering/research/softlab/), University of Bristol. I work with [Prof. Jonathan Rossiter](http://www.bris.ac.uk/engineering/people/person/jonathan-m-rossiter/overview.html) and [Dr. Andrew Conn](http://www.bris.ac.uk/engineering/people/person/andrew-t-conn/overview.html).
My PhD is part of the [FARSCOPE programme](http://farscope.bris.ac.uk/) at the [Bristol Robotics Lab](http://brl.ac.uk).

My current work focuses on replicating locomotion through shape change. I am looking at the *Euglena* family of microorganisms, understanding their unique manner of swimming and designing robots that mimic this behaviour.

Check out some of my projects and feel free to contact me.
