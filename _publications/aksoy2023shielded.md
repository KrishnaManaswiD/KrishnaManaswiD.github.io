## Abstract
We report electrically shielded capacitive stretchable force sensors, that simultaneously measure normal and shear strains, even near electric sparks. The device consists of an outer conductive stretchable shielding layer (carbon-loaded silicone) and a central silicone layer with embedded air channels and three liquid metal electrodes. We report sub-mN force resolution in both normal and shear directions, can measure forces larger than 10 N, and operate reliably after repeated loading to 20 N load. Performance is unaffected by nearby high DC and AC electric fields, allowing use in a wide range of robotic sensing applications.
