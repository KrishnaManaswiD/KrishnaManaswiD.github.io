Working with colleagues from my year, we programmed a robot to perform the taks specidifed by the amazon picking challenge. 
The task involved identification of objets placed on a shelf, directing a robot to move to that object, picking it up and placing it into a box for delivery.
My role in the project was to train a computer vision program using a neural network to recognise the various objects.
