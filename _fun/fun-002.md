[Chanelle Lee](https://twitter.com/ChanelleLLee), [Daniel Carrillo-Zapata](https://twitter.com/danicarzap?lang=en) and I delivered workshops at schools in the Nancy-Metz region of France in collaboration with the British Council's [Science in Schools](https://www.britishcouncil.fr/en/education/schools/educational-projects/science-schools) programme. We interacted with over 200 students, aged 9-12 and spread acorss 9 schools. Our goal was to test whether students would still have fun, learn something new and gain an interest in STEM even when the workshop was conducted in a foreign language - the kids spoke French while we spoke only English). Our results are summarised in a paper that we presented at the 10th International Conference on Robots in Education.
